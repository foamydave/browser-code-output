<!--
HTML Output
===========

This is the HTML file where all your code output appears. Double click/launch 
this page in any browser.Though you could write JavaScript code here, it is 
better to keep it in a separate file which is what has been done. You can find 
the code in code.js.

There are 3 code output areas below and each one cooresponds to the 3 functions
in code.js. 
	1) Output 1 occurs when the page is first loaded or refreshed. No user 
		interaction is required.
	2) Output 2 occurs only after the user has pressed Submit 2.
	3) Output 3 can take user input visa Input 3 and executes when Submit 3 is
		pressed.

If you change the code in code.js you need to reload/refresh the browser window
to allow the changes to take effect.

Because this is running in a browser, it normally requires that any output use 
a <br> tag to cause a newline to appear. However, the style has been altered so 
that the '\n' is honored as a new line to keep things simlple.

A CSS file has been included and the style is very simple.
This keeps you focued on the code and not the UI. If you get to a point where
you want to dress-up your program then an external CSS can be modified. There
is an external CSS file reference in the <head> tag pointing to the style.css 
file.
